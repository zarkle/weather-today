# Weather Today
### Node.js and Flask versions

#### Node.js (JavaScript)
A weather app using Node.js and the OpenWeather API to return the current weather in a city. There are 2 versions:

[Console](https://github.com/zarkle/weather-today/tree/master/weather-app-console): A CLI version of the app.

[Web](https://github.com/zarkle/weather-today/tree/master/weather-app-web): A fullstack web app version.

Note: You should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine already.

You will also need an account on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) (don't worry, it's free).  Once signed in, select the API Keys tab. This is where your API key is that you will need later.


#### Flask (Python)
A [weather app](https://github.com/zarkle/weather-today/tree/master/weather-today-flask) using Python's [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework and the OpenWeather API to return the current weather in a city. Every request will also be recorded in a postgresql database.
