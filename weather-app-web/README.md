# Weather Today
A web app to get the current temperature in any city.

To use:  
**Reminder: You should have Node.js and npm installed on your machine and an account on OpenWeather.
- Clone or download this repo to your local machine and `cd` into the weather-app-web directory
- Run `npm i` to install dependencies
- If you haven't yet, make an account on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) (don't worry, it's free)
- Once signed in to OpenWeather, select the API Keys tab and copy your default API key
- Make a file named `.env` and paste in your API key (see `env_sample` file if you need help). The file should only contain `export APIKEY=<apikey>` replacing `<apikey>` with your API key.
- Finally, run `npm start` to start the server and open your browser to `localhost:3000` to use the app.
